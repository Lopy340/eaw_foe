 EAW_WS_TAB_3_TXT:0 "\n\n£eaw_text  §YEquestria at War§! incorporates a fork of §YExpanded Technology + Industry + Equipment§! by §YGreatexperiment§! (used with permission), that has been edited and streamlined to fit our design goals better. This allows for a longer game with more technologies to research.\n\nEaW introduces §YMagical Equipment§! and a new resource - £resources_strip|7  §YCrystals§! - used to produce it. §YMagical Equipment§! provides a more resource, IC-intensive, less reliable, but more powerful alternative to regular §YInfantry Equipment§!.\n\n§YPre-Industrial Infantry Equipment§! and §YArtillery§! have been added, to represent the weapons used by nations that have not yet industrialized.\n\nFurthermore, EaW introduced the §YRaces§! system. Each country has one of five races - §Ypony§!, §Ychangeling§!, §Ygriffon§!, §Ydeer§! and §YUnspecified§! (with more races planned). Each race has its own unique racial tech tree folder, and in some cases racial unique units. Races cannot be changed during the game (exception being an option for the §YChangeling-Olenian Commonwealth§!).\n\n\n\nIn order to better represent the differences in industrial/societal and research development of nations in Equestria at War, §YDevelopment§! and §YScientific Development§! idea categories have been implemented.\n\n§YDevelopment§! represents the general state of industrialization and advancement of economy and society. Low levels of §YDevelopment§! impose §RIndustry§!, §RResearch§! and §RPolitical§! maluses. §YDevelopment§! can be improved by §YNational Focuses§! or §YDecisions§!, depending on the country.\n\n§YScientific Development§! represents the level of education and research capabilities of the nation. Low levels of §YScientific Development§! impose §RResearch§! maluses. §YScientific Development§! can be improved by §YNational Focuses§! or §YDecisions§!, depending on the country. For §Ygriffon§! countries, owning major centers of learning in Griffonia can be used to improve §YScientific Development§! as well.\n\n\n\nThe potential of nuclear warfare and the horror of unleashing such terrible weapons is not quite seen in Vanilla. In order to rectify this, EaW introduces the following changes:\n- Nuclear attacks will now reduce the population of a hit §Ystate§!, using believable casualty numbers depending on state population and development (using multiple nuclear bombs on a state in short succession will not reduce population as drastically).\n- A §Ystate§! hit by a nuclear attack will receive the §YFallout§! state modifier, reducing state factories, supplies, division organization and increasing division attrition. The modifier will last for a §Yyear§!. Subsequent nuclear attacks will not stack the modifier, but will reset the one year timer.\n- Production of §Ynuclear bombs§! requires a supply of £resources_strip|7  §YCrystals§!. If none are available, no new §Ynuclear bombs§! will be produced. Each §YNuclear Reactor§! consumes 12 £resources_strip|7  §YCrystals§!.\n\n\n\nAfter a country has been defeated in a war, and a peace conference has ended, the victors will have a chance to receive §Yone-time 50% research speed bonuses§! to §Ytechnologies§! that the loser had researched, and the victor has not.\n\nThe chance to receive the bonus is random, and calculated per technology. The more of loser's §YIndustry§! that has been taken over by the victor (either by puppeting or annexation), the higher the chance to receive a bonus, which means that not every victor will have an equal chance. The level of §YDevelopment§! of the victor is also a factor - the worse the Development, the smaller the chance.\n\n\n\nAn effort was made to improve the AI. While it is by no means perfect, and most of the real improvements can only be implemented by Paradox, we have done our best to tweak AI's behaviors, and improve AI's handling of Division Templates. AI will use all of the added units and technologies. AI will intelligently choose Doctrines based on the bonuses they recieve in their Focus Tree. AI will use dynamic strategies to respond to events and changes on the world stage. Peace Conference AI has been improved, though it is not perfect.\n\n\n\nSince 1.6 Ironclad update, new Game Rules for various countries and game setups have been added, to allow the player to customize their £eaw_text  §YEquestria at War§! experience."

 FOE_WS_Manehattan:0 "Manehattan Ruins"
 FOE_WS_Manehattan_desc:0 "Before the end of the world §YManehatten§! was a bustling city, and as such it was called “The Mare that never sleeps“. Manehatten may have been far from the zebras and the war, but it’s effects were still felt.\n\nSkyscrapers once towered over the city, like the glittering Tenpony and Horseshoe Towers, which were each hubs for the Ministry of Arcane Sciences and Morale respectively. Many bridges connected the Manehattan Peninsula, like the famous §YBucklyn Bridge§!. Nothing compared to the gigantic statue of the §YPony of Friendship§!, who eternally watched over the city from its island. Now, however, it is all in ruin.\n\nWhen the new world was baptized by balefire radiation in 1035 was the second place hit by megaspells, and Manehatten was transformed into a hostile ruin. And for the survivors not kept safe in Tenpony Tower, life is harsh, and §Rraiders§! and §Rmonsters§! now hunt in the city.\n\nSome semblance of order was restored in 1089 when the §YSteel Rangers§! arrived, and set up shop in the ruins of the Bucklyn Bridge, now known as Bucklyn Cross and provided a bulwark against the terrors of the city, despite their isolationist tendencies.\n\nAll of the city’s Skyscrapers fell during the end of the world, or were severely damaged and most of their inhabitants incinerated,  all that is except for §YTenpony Tower§!, which was protected by its magical shields. Control of the tower was established by the high mages that worked for the Ministry of Arcane Sciences, who now style themselves as the ‘Twilight Society’. Now, despite being one of the last bastions of old world knowledge (and the place where the idealistic DJ-PON3 broadcasts from), only the rich are allowed to live in the tower, and no ghouls are permitted to even step hoof into the tower."
